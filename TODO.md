- Fix setup.py entry point and remove duplicate page functions in app.py.
- Refactor scalable_processor multiprocessing to avoid pickling self and torch objects; use a top-level worker and as_completed.
- Pin dependencies; split extras:
  - Core: streamlit, numpy, pandas, rasterio, folium, plotly.
  - sam: torch==<pinned>, segment-anything==<pinned or commit>, opencv-python.
  - gee: earthengine-api.
- Make web tests optional/marked integration (skip by default) or add a test fixture that boots the app in the background for the test run.
- Add a tiny sample dataset or a robust mock path so the app always loads without hidden assets.
- Remove or fix lazy_imports.py (correct module path or delete if unused).
- Add CI (format, lint, unit tests) and a minimal smoke test that doesnâ€™t require the full model/data.
- Replace private Streamlit config calls with documented alternatives (or guard them tightly and accept best-effort).
- Improve GEE routines to avoid .getInfo() loops and note quota considerations in docs.
