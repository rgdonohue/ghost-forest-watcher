## üéØ Project Overview

Ghost Forest Watcher is a **production-ready** web application that monitors forest recovery patterns following the 2020 East Troublesome Fire in Colorado. Using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM), the application provides AI-powered analysis of vegetation health and recovery trends.

**Key Results:** Analysis shows **80.8% healthy recovery**, **15.6% stressed vegetation**, and **2.5% severely impacted areas** in the study region.

## Why it Matters

Western Colorado's forests are increasingly threatened by drought, bark beetle infestations, and wildfires. This project makes forest degradation visible using modern AI workflows, supporting ecological awareness and climate justice.

## Project Initialization

1. **Initialize Git (if not already done):**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Register and authenticate with Google Earth Engine:**
   - [Sign up for GEE](https://earthengine.google.com/)
   - Authenticate using the Python API:
     ```bash
     earthengine authenticate
     ```
4. **Download model weights:**
   - Follow instructions for [SAM](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) and [GroundingDINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO)

## Google Earth Engine Setup

To use Google Earth Engine (GEE) for this project:

1. **Create a GEE account**:
   - Visit [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) and sign up
   - Request access to the Earth Engine API
   - Wait for approval (usually within 1-2 business days)

2. **Create a Google Cloud Project**:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project (or use an existing one)
   - Enable the Earth Engine API for your project
   - Note your project ID (you'll need it for authentication)

3. **Install the earthengine-api package**:
   ```bash
   pip install earthengine-api
   ```

4. **Authenticate with GEE**:
   ```bash
   earthengine authenticate
   ```
   - This will open a browser window for you to log in with your Google account
   - Grant the requested permissions
   - Copy the authorization code back to your terminal

5. **Initialize GEE with your project**:
   In your Python code, always initialize with your project ID:
   ```python
   import ee
   ee.Initialize(project='your-project-id')
   ```

6. **Test your GEE setup**:
   - Run the template notebook: `notebooks/gee_preprocessing_template.ipynb`
   - Make sure to specify your project ID when initializing
   - If authentication is successful, you should be able to query Sentinel-2 imagery
